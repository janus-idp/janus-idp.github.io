description: Future of the Janus IDP community

We wanted to update the Janus community around the current state of the project, and how our involvement with the upstream Backstage community will impact the Janus community moving forward.

The original intent of the Janus project was to provide a community where Red Hat could collaborate with other teams, customers, partners and interested parties to advance and evolve the Backstage upstream project. Through the Janus community, the project has successfully contributed to a number of key initiatives in the upstream project, such as dynamic plugin support, the upstream [Helm chart](https://github.com/backstage/charts), and the contribution of a number of plugins. Additionally, we are now an active partner in the [Backstage Community Plugins SIG](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs/sig-community-plugins).

The Janus community has made impactful contributions which have shaped the wider platform. Based on this success, we now see a path forward where much of our efforts can be consolidated with the upstream. This may however render aspects of the Janus project redundant or unnecessary. We anticipate no loss of content or features from the Janus project, but we do expect content to gradually move to new locations, and we will endeavor to keep our community and users updated as to when and where the content has moved:

- Most of the Janus IDP plugins are in scope to be migrated to the upstream [Community Plugins for Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins) community
- Helm Chart has moved from [janus-idp/helm-backstage](https://github.com/janus-idp/helm-backstage) to [redhat-developer/rhdh-chart](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart)
- [janus-idp/backstage-customization-provider](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-customization-provider) has migrated to [redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider](https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-customization-provider)
- [janus-idp/software-templates](https://github.com/janus-idp/software-templates) have migrated to [redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-software-templates](https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-software-templates)
