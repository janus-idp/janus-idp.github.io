## Join the community

Start by joining our community. We have a <SocialLink social="slack" text="janus-idp"/> Slack workspace that you can join and meet other Janus users. In all our communications, on whatever platform, we expect everyone to follow a code of contact.

You may also join our <SocialLink social="mailingList" text="community mailing list"/> and see our <SocialLink social="calendar" text="community calendar"/>.

Feel free to watch our recorded meetings and follow us on <SocialLink social="youtube"/>.
